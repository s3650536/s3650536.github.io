Interest in IT

I am mostly interested in Programming, security in computing, cloud computing and Web development. I think IT is a very broad program, there is more to it than we know, we live in a technological age, where everything around us is changing to digital and everyday there is a new discovery that blows everyone’s minds
I would say my interest in IT began right after high school, at that time I did not know what I wanted to do or become in the future, so I decide to take up a short course in IT at a Tafe near where I lived. A few weeks into the course and I got so fascinated with how you can create programs, build networks and process data, it is just amazing what one can do with a computer.  I was very much interested in it and wanted to continue further studies, so after the short course I decided to apply to RMIT.
The decision to come to RMIT was rather spontaneous I should say. I always wanted to come to Australia for studies and the city I was hoping to further my studies in was Melbourne. I searched for university around the city and saw that RMIT was right in the heart of Melbourne, I read more about RMIT and learned how outstanding the institution is. So, I decided why not give it a shot and see what happens.  
I expect to learn as much as I can, knowledge is just amazing, every day there is something newly discovered which means something new to learn. I hope to utilize all my skills and ability to learn as much as I can while I am in my program. And it doesn’t stop after I complete my program, I hope to learn more and more every day, whatever piece of information I can get my hands on that interests me to further my knowledge in IT.
