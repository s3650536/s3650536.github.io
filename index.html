								<h2 class="major">Background Information</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG-6019.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Born and raised in Wewak, a small town north of Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is a very culturally diverse country, we have the people form the islands, the coastal region of the mainland and the people of the Highlands. Fun fact, I am a very adventurous person, who is always up for a road trip, camping and travelling to different places and experiencing different cultures. Favourite sport growing up includes football and rugby but as I grew older I lost interests in football and got more involved in rugby.
</p>
								<h2> Personal profile </h2>
								<p>Myers-Briggs test states that my personality type is “The Consul,” which means, people that are popular and very outgoing, always open to have a discussion, always spotted at a party having a good time with friends. The Online learning style test indicates that I am an Auditory/Visual learner. Which means I may learn things by listening and reading or seeing pictures. I can easily store and remember information by the way it sounds and I can understand and remember things that I see, by visualising it in my head. The online test I chose was Big Five Personality Test, the result I got sates that I was labelled as Extroversion, which means I have positive emotionality and I am an outgoing social person. These results indicate that when working in a team, I will get a long with all my team members, because I am an outgoing person who likes to converse and interact with people, I will be the life of the team, someone who is very social and has a positive attitude which brings up the team spirit whenever the members are feeling down or just not into it. To be honest, when forming a team, I would not take these results under consideration. I believe everyone is unique in their own way, hence we all should work together despite our differences. Now that’s what team work is all about, different people coming together to produce something outstanding. </p>

						<!-- Interest in IT -->
							<article id="interest">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>I am mostly interested in Programming, security in computing, cloud computing and Web development. I think IT is a very broad program, there is more to it than we know, we live in a technological age, where everything around us is changing to digital and everyday there is a new discovery that blows everyone’s minds I would say my interest in IT began right after high school, at that time I did not know what I wanted to do or become in the future, so I decide to take up a short course in IT at a Tafe near where I lived. A few weeks into the course and I got so fascinated with how you can create programs, build networks and process data, it is just amazing what one can do with a computer. I was very much interested in it and wanted to continue further studies, so after the short course I decided to apply to RMIT. The decision to come to RMIT was rather spontaneous I should say. I always wanted to come to Australia for studies and the city I was hoping to further my studies in was Melbourne. I searched for university around the city and saw that RMIT was right in the heart of Melbourne, I read more about RMIT and learned how outstanding the institution is. So, I decided why not give it a shot and see what happens. </p>
								<p>I expect to learn as much as I can, knowledge is just amazing, every day there is something newly discovered which means something new to learn. I hope to utilize all my skills and ability to learn as much as I can while I am in my program. And it doesn’t stop after I complete my program, I hope to learn more and more every day, whatever piece of information I can get my hands on that interests me to further my knowledge in IT.

						<!-- Project ideas -->
							<article id="ideas">
								<h2 class="major">Project ideas</h2>
								<p> I will be planning is app development for smartphones. The app I am trying to develop will be called CarFix, so basically it is an app that helps individuals especially car owners that has a problem with their vehicle and they don’t know what is wrong with it or how to solve the problem, it lets the user know the problem with their vehicle and can also give them a step by step instructions to undergo in order for them to fix their car by replacing a certain car part, adjust a certain area or even replace fluids in the vehicle. The app will also let users know what tools and equipment they need to use to get the job done. All in all, Users will have a clear understanding with the issue and have a certain idea how to execute the problem all in the palm of their hands.</p>
								<p> Nowadays almost everyone owns a car but only a few have a basic understanding of how to fix it when their car breaks down, and mechanics and be very pricey at times. Statistics show that there were 19.2 million registered motor vehicles in Australia as at 31st January 2018, and it is very likely that almost half of the owners do not have an idea on how to go about resolving the problem when their vehicle is not running well. As result owners may know exactly the problem they have with their vehicle, they can choose to fix it themselves using the application as a guide instead of taking it to the auto shop and spend a large amount of money on a simple thing such as changing a battery or spark plug. It is cheap, it gives users a basic understanding of the vehicle they are driving, which will be useful in the long run, users may not always rely on what the mechanics tell them and users get to save money.
								</p>
								<p>The application will only work with recent model vehicles, as recent as 2012 because of the On-Board Diagnostics Tool second generation (OBD -II) Scanners located on the dashboard of the vehicles which gives indications when something is wrong with the vehicle. Firstly, when users launch the app they have to connect it to their OBD tool on thei motor vehicle. The features included in the app are MyCar, where all the details of the user’s motor-vehicle are stored, from the basic tire sizes and battery type to even greater details such as engine anatomy. Secondly, we have the Diagnostics feature, where possible problems of the user’s vehicle are registered, then there is the History feature where all the past problems are stored. There's the FixMyCar feature where all the instructions, animations and the tools needed to fix the users car are stored. Lastly there's the search bar feature where you can search up to anything about your vehicle to get a further understanding, the app may also lead users to outside sources if the it cannot find the result. So basically, what happens is the monitor sensors collects data from the systems all over the vehicle and does troubleshooting OBD then picks up the problem. From there the user can link his/her phone using the carfix app to the OBD and the user can see what the fault is. The app will search up the problem on its database and come up with a solution to do about it and solve the issue. If the user finds that the issue is too big to take on the users can bring it to the auto-shop and see a mechanic. However, if the user chooses to repair the problem by him/herself the app gives step-by-step instructions in which the users can undergo to fix the problem. The app also registers the problems the user encounters down for future references, so when users want to do a full service that requires a professional they can show their local repair-shop on the problems they have encountered, so the mechanic can know exactly what to do.</p>
								<p>This project clearly requires a lot of work and involves people from different areas of specialty to work together. Firstly, Human resources are greatly needed for this project, we need people in mechanical, automotive, and software engineering to work together. Secondly, every car model and make in Australia along with their manual has to be taken into consideration and get registered into the application systems. Last but not least, users must have an OBD 2 in order for the app to function. The main skills required for this is excellent programming skills combine with mechanical skills, these two areas of principle need to work together in order for a successful result. The programming of the application can be done using Java or JavaScript, programmers must be very good when it comes to object-oriented programming because this project requires a lot of work and must be very detailed for it to be a success.
 </p>
								<p>To conclude, if this project happens to be successful, it will help people understand the problem with their vehicle if they happen to come across one, they can also save a bit of money by attempting resolve the problem themselves other than bringing it into the repair shop and another important aspect is that it can decrease the rate in accidence caused by faulty issues with motor vehicles. It will also help mechanics have a clear understanding of their job and how to go about it. Clearly This app will be a game changer and will bring a positive contribution to the world. </p>
